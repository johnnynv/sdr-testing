    "# Streaming Data to RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems rely on static data ingested in batches, which limits their ability to support time-critical use cases like emergency response or live monitoring. These situations require immediate access to dynamic data sources such as sensor feeds or radio signals. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Streaming Data to RAG developer example solves this by enabling RAG systems to process live data streams in real-time. It features a GPU-accelerated software-defined radio (SDR) pipeline that continuously captures radio frequency (RF) signals, transcribes them into searchable text, embeds, and indexes them in real time. This live data is then fed to a large language model (LLM), allowing context-aware queries over dynamic streams.\n",
    "\n",
    "Designed for scalability across edge and cloud environments, this reference example unlocks real-time situational awareness for use cases like spectrum monitoring, intelligence gathering, and other mission-critical applications—while retaining RAG’s strengths in delivering accurate, relevant results. \n",
