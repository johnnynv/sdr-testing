# PDF Q&A Example

This example demonstrates how to use NVIDIA's Context-Aware RAG (CA-RAG) system for PDF document processing and question answering. The example shows how to:
- Extract text and tables from PDF documents
- Ingest documents into the CA-RAG system
- Perform question answering on the ingested documents

### Prerequisites

1. NVIDIA API Keys:
   - Get your API keys from: [build.nvidia.com](https://build.nvidia.com)
   - Export the following environment variables:
     ```bash
     export NVIDIA_BUILD_API_KEY=your_build_api_key
     export NVIDIA_API_KEY=your_api_key
     ```

2. Install NV-Ingest:
   - Follow the installation instructions at: [NV Ingest](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nv-ingest/)

### Setup

1. Start the required services using docker-compose:
   - [Docker Deployment](../guides/docker/compose.md)

2. Start the NV-Ingest client:
   - The example uses a pipeline configuration with Milvus for vector storage

### Usage

1. **Document Processing**:
   - Place your PDF documents in the `data/` directory
   - The example processes PDFs to extract:
     - Text content
     - Tables
     - Charts
     - Note: Image extraction is not supported in the current version

2. **Document Ingestion**:
   - Documents are processed and uploaded to the ingestion service
   - The system maintains document order and metadata
   - A terminating document is added to mark the end of the document set

3. **Question Answering**:
   - Initialize the retrieval service with the same UUID used for ingestion
   - Send questions to the retrieval service
   - Receive answers based on the ingested document content

### Example Notebook

The [pdf_qna.ipynb](https://github.com/NVIDIA/context-aware-rag/blob/main/examples/pdf_qna.ipynb) notebook provides a step-by-step walkthrough of the entire process, including:
- Service initialization
- Document processing and ingestion
- Question answering examples

### Notes

- The current version does not support image extraction from PDFs
- For optimal PDF processing, especially for scanned documents, consider using the `nemoretriever_parse` extraction method
- The system uses markdown format for text extraction output
