# Architecture Patterns

![image](../_static/data_architecture.png)

-   vss_ctx_rag allows the user to start both a Data Ingestion Service
    and a Data Retrieval Service
    -   The Data Ingestion Service is responsible for ingesting data
        into the database
        -   Database can be plug and play, Milvus, Neo4j, etc.
    -   The Data Retrieval Service is responsible for retrieving data
        from the database
        -   Utilizes Graph-RAG or Vector-RAG to retrieve relevant
            documents from the database to answer the user\'s query

      end

      %% The Context Manager invokes Tools and Functions
      Functions --> |Uses| Tools


      %% Dynamic selection among functions based on the RAG approach

      CF -- "Calls" --> VRF

### Context Manager

The Context Manager is the central coordinator of the system. Its
responsibilities include:

-   **Asynchronous Processing**:
    -   Manages the flow between data ingestion, function execution, and
        final document retrieval.
    -   Calls different functions based on the analysis of user queries
        and the type of RAG (Graph-RAG vs. Vector-RAG) configured.
-   **Dynamic Function Execution**:
    -   Loads and configures various functions (e.g., ChatFunction,
        Summarization Functions) by leveraging the modular function and
        tool interfaces.
    -   Configurable with different RAG approaches (vector-based,
        graph-based)

### Tools and Functions

The system is built upon a clear separation between the logic
(functions) and external dependencies (tools):

-   **Tools**:
    -   Tools encapsulate the logic for interacting with external
        services such as databases (Neo4j for graph data, Milvus for
        vector embeddings).
    -   Examples include:
        -   **MilvusDBTool**:
            -   Interfaces with the Milvus vector database to manage
                document embeddings.
            -   Provides efficient similarity searching by indexing and
                retrieving document embeddings.
        -   **Neo4jGraphDB (Neo4jTool)**:
            -   Provides integration with the Neo4j graph database to
                store and query graph representations of documents.
            -   Supports advanced retrieval strategies by converting
                documents into graph structures and executing cypher
                queries to retrieve relationships, entities, and
                structured information from the graph.
        -   **NotificationTool**:
            -   Serves as a lightweight interface for dispatching
                notifications and alerts within the system.
            -   Can be extended to integrate with various notification
                endpoints.
-   **Functions**:
    -   The Function serves as the base interface for implementing
        processing routines in the Context Manager.
    -   Examples include:
        -   **ChatFunction**:
            -   Handles chat interactions
            -   Manages conversation context
            -   Integrates with LLM for response generation
        -   **GraphExtractionFunc**:
            -   Processes documents into graph representations
            -   Handles entity extraction and relationship mapping
            -   Manages document chunking and embedding generation
        -   **GraphRetrievalFunc**:
            -   Retrieves information using graph-based approach
            -   Implements vector similarity search
            -   Manages context assembly for LLM
        -   **VectorRetrievalFunc**:
            -   Retrieves information using vector-based approach
            -   Handles embedding-based similarity search
            -   Manages document ranking and selection

### Design Patterns

-   Async/await for concurrent operations
    -   Prevents context manager from blocking the main process
    -   Utilizes asynchronous processing to handle requests
-   Interface-based design (Tool, Function)
    -   Allows for easy extension and modification of components
    -   Allows for easy integration of new tools and functions

### Implementation Patterns

-   Factory pattern for component creation
-   Strategy pattern for different RAG approaches
-   Observer pattern for event handling
-   Repository pattern for data access
